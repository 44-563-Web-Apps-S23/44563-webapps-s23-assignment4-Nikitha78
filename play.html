    <p>JOEL. [_With a singing call._] Four o'clock!--All's well!

        [_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._<p><br>
   
   <p>ANDREW. By God, Joel, it's bitter.</p><br>
   
   <p>JOEL. [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] A mite sharpish.</p><br>
   
   <p>ANDREW. [_Looks up eagerly._] What?</p><br>
   
   <p>JOEL. Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'.</p><br>
   
   <p>ANDREW. [_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] I wondered you should
    agree with me. You meant the weather.</p><br>
   
  <p> JOEL. Well, Andy, what'd you mean?</p>
